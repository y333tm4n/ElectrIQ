# ElectrIQ

ElectrIQ is a mobile application designed to empower Filipino consumers to make informed decisions when purchasing home appliances. By providing a platform for easy comparison and access to valuable data. Furthermore, ElectrIQ aims to guide users towards energy-efficient appliances, lowering their long-term electricity bills. As well as equipping consumers with the knowledge to compare brands, models, and their associated operating costs.

## Features
**1. User-Centric Comparison (Main Working Feature):**

- While existing solutions might offer basic appliance comparisons, ElectrIQ personalizes the experience. Users can define their comparison criteria beyond just brand and model. Imagine a young couple specifically looking for a refrigerator with high energy efficiency but also needing a spacious freezer for their growing family. ElectrIQ allows them to filter and compare based on these specific needs.

**2. Cost-Benefit Analysis:**

- ElectrIQ goes beyond just estimated costs. It can project the potential long-term savings of choosing a more energy-efficient model over its lifespan. This empowers young families to make informed decisions about their budget, factoring in not just the initial appliance cost but also the potential savings on electricity bills over time.

**3. Educational Resources:**

- ElectrIQ doesn't just provide data; it educates. The app offers a dedicated section with clear and concise information on energy efficiency, how to interpret Meralco orange tags, and practical tips for using appliances responsibly. This empowers young adults, who may be new to managing a household, to make informed choices and develop sustainable habits.

**4. Actionable Insights:**

- Instead of just displaying a list of Meralco-tested appliances, ElectrIQ can leverage location services (with user permission) to show which brands and models are readily available for purchase in nearby stores. This empowers young adults to take immediate action on their informed decisions.
